Predicting the next Newtown or Parkland shooting

\section{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Problem:}}{Problem:}}\label{problem}

A leader of the free-world, United States of America has more people
dying of gun violence than any other developed country, 29.7 per 1
million people. Since Sandy hook, Newtown incident in 2012, there have
been over 1600 mass shootings in America. A mass shooting is defined as
over 3 deaths in a shooting, excluding the gunman. Where there is no
doubt that more guns equal more deaths due to guns, the debate on gun
violence intensifies with an Parkland shooting like incident, but lasts
for just a few weeks resulting in no significant changes in the gun
laws. As a matter of fact the rate of mass shooting has increased in the
last 2 years as compared to the last 6 years combined. And with another
political standstill, there will be more victims to the mass shootings
in America.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Who might
care?}}{Who might care?}}\label{who-might-care}

Anybody with a right mind in America should care about and value human
life. To minimize the problem, changing laws at a federal level alone
will not solve the problem. This study can enable the local law
enforcement, medical, and government agencies to reduce the possibility
of a mass shooting in their community. This project can bring
significant changes to today's approach to gun violence, from
reactionary to precautionary.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\emph{DATA}}{DATA}}\label{data}

The data will be acquired from the following

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item

\item
  \url{https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/}
\end{enumerate}

The data contains information of gun related incidents from early 90's
to present by year, state, city. The data set includes, data on crime,
mental health and gun ownership by state, city, year, gender and age.
For this project, I will focus on 15 years of data, starting year 2002,
with an underlying assumption that the data prior to 2002 is not going
to significantly impact this analysis, due to changes in geo-political,
cultural and technological trend and outlooks.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Modeling
approach:}}{Modeling approach:}}\label{modeling-approach}

I will explore the correlation between gun-sales, mental-health, general
crime, and mass shootings. TBD\ldots{}. Need to know more about the
modeling techniques, algorithms etc\ldots{}.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\emph{Possible
limitations:}}{Possible limitations:}}\label{possible-limitations}

Unfortunately, less than 5\% of the mass shootings ever get any national
media attention. In the other 95\%, the factors leading to ``mass
shootings'' is family or personal disputes. Which are very challenging
to ascertain and predict. Given my current skillset and other obvious
challenges, I have currently, also left-out the social media analysis
for this project. I might reconsider this at a later stage in the
project.
